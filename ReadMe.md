# Tic-Tac-Toe Game 🎮

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game project! This project implements a simple tic-tac-toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns clicking on cells in a grid to place their marks (X or O). The game checks for a winner or a tie after each move and displays appropriate messages. Players can reset the game at any time.

2. Click on a cell to place your mark (X or O).

5. Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.
